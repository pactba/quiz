# A student covers their ears when the fire alarm rings, which stops the loud noise immediately.  

This question tests understanding of the difference between escape and avoidance behavior.  

1. [ ] Access to a preferred stimulus.  
> Incorrect. That would describe positive reinforcement, not termination of an aversive event.  

2. [ ] Postponing a stimulus.  
> Incorrect. This describes avoidance, not escape.  

3. [x] Terminating an ongoing aversive stimulus.  
> Correct! Escape occurs when a behavior ends an already-present aversive stimulus (p. 302).  

4. [ ] Conditioned reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. This describes a different reinforcement mechanism, not escape.  

# A client quickly completes a difficult math problem when the teacher says, “If you finish now, we’ll stop.”  

This question targets immediacy and intensity in negative reinforcement effectiveness.  

1. [ ] Weak aversive, continuously present.  
> Incorrect. Weak stimuli do not reliably strengthen behavior.  

2. [ ] Mild aversive, unpredictable.  
> Incorrect. Unpredictability may reduce learning of the contingency.  

3. [ ] Intermittent intense aversive.  
> Incorrect. Intermittent pairing is less effective than immediate termination.  

4. [x] Intense aversive, terminated immediately after response.  
> Correct! Strong, immediate termination maximizes negative reinforcement (pp. 304–305).  

# During a laboratory procedure, responses delay shock but no warning stimulus is given.  

This question checks knowledge of free-operant and Sidman avoidance.  

1. [ ] Fixed-ratio schedule.  
> Incorrect. FR schedules involve response requirements, not avoidance.  

2. [ ] Fixed-interval schedule.  
> Incorrect. FI schedules are based on time, not avoidance.  

3. [ ] Sidman avoidance.  
> Incorrect. Sidman avoidance involves no warning stimulus but uses shock-shock intervals.  

4. [x] Free-operant avoidance.  
> Correct! In free-operant avoidance, responses postpone shocks without warning cues (pp. 309–310).  

# A student raises their hand to avoid losing points for blurting.  

This question highlights discriminated avoidance.  

1. [ ] Escape behavior.  
> Incorrect. No aversive stimulus was already present to terminate.  

2. [x] Discriminated avoidance.  
> Correct! The SD (teacher’s rules) signals potential loss of points if behavior occurs (p. 303).  

3. [ ] Free-operant avoidance.  
> Incorrect. There is no ongoing timer-based schedule here.  

4. [ ] Response cost.  
> Incorrect. No reinforcer was removed after the behavior.  

# A worker always fastens their seatbelt to silence the car buzzer.  

This question distinguishes applied examples of negative reinforcement.  

1. [ ] Positive reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. No preferred stimulus is added.  

2. [x] Negative reinforcement.  
> Correct! The behavior terminates an aversive buzzer (p. 301).  

3. [ ] Extinction.  
> Incorrect. Extinction involves withholding reinforcement, not terminating a stimulus.  

4. [ ] Punishment.  
> Incorrect. Punishment decreases behavior; here behavior increases.  

# A child’s problem behavior continues even though escape from tasks is rare.  

This question tests the persistence of avoidance behavior.  

1. [ ] Warning stimulus as conditioned reinforcer.  
> Incorrect. That explains discriminated avoidance, not persistence.  

2. [x] Absence of aversive events acts as reinforcement.  
> Correct! Avoidance responding is maintained by preventing aversive events (pp. 308–309).  

3. [ ] Extinction procedure.  
> Incorrect. Extinction involves withholding reinforcement, not avoidance.  

4. [ ] FR shaping.  
> Incorrect. Avoidance is not dependent on fixed-ratio shaping.  

# A therapist prevents a child from escaping demands following tantrums.  

This question assesses understanding of escape extinction.  

1. [ ] Reinforcing escape on FR schedule.  
> Incorrect. That would strengthen escape behavior.  

2. [x] Blocking escape contingent on problem behavior.  
> Correct! Escape extinction occurs when problem behavior no longer produces escape (pp. 316–317).  

3. [ ] Punishing escape behavior.  
> Incorrect. Punishment is not the same as extinction.  

4. [ ] Fading aversive stimulus.  
> Incorrect. That is a different intervention.  

# A child exposed to unavoidable aversive stimuli stops trying to escape.  

This question probes learned helplessness.  

1. [ ] Rapid suppression of avoidance.  
> Incorrect. Suppression is temporary, not learned helplessness.  

2. [x] Learned helplessness.  
> Correct! Unavoidable aversives often result in learned helplessness (p. 313).  

3. [ ] Strengthened escape responding.  
> Incorrect. Escape responding declines, not strengthens.  

4. [ ] Conditioned reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. This involves pairing with reinforcers, not helplessness.  

# A teacher reprimands a student after blurting, and the behavior decreases.  

This question checks the definition of positive punishment.  

1. [x] Positive punishment.  
> Correct! Adding an aversive stimulus (reprimand) reduces behavior (p. 330).  

2. [ ] Negative punishment.  
> Incorrect. Nothing was removed.  

3. [ ] Extinction.  
> Incorrect. Extinction involves withholding reinforcement.  

4. [ ] Differential reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. No alternative behavior was reinforced.  

# 
A child loses recess time after talking out of turn.  

This question identifies negative punishment.  

1. [ ] Positive punishment.  
> Incorrect. No stimulus was added.  

2. [x] Negative punishment.  
> Correct! A reinforcer (recess) is removed following behavior (pp. 331–332).  

3. [ ] Extinction.  
> Incorrect. Reinforcement was not withheld.  

4. [ ] Overcorrection.  
> Incorrect. No effortful corrective action was required.  

# 
A teacher increases intensity of a punisher gradually over time.  

This question examines the effect of punisher intensity.  

1. [ ] More effective than immediate high intensity.  
> Incorrect. Gradual increases reduce effectiveness.  

2. [x] Less effective than high intensity from onset.  
> Correct! Punishers are most effective when intense from the start (p. 340).  

3. [ ] Equally effective as continuous punishment.  
> Incorrect. Delivery schedule differs.  

4. [ ] Independent of intensity.  
> Incorrect. Intensity strongly matters.  

# 
A child who throws blocks is required to pick up not only their own blocks but all blocks in the area.  

This question identifies restitutional overcorrection.  

1. [ ] Negative punishment.  
> Incorrect. No reinforcer was removed.  

2. [x] Restitutional overcorrection.  
> Correct! Effortful restitutional behavior is required (p. 345).  

3. [ ] Response cost.  
> Incorrect. No reinforcer was removed.  

4. [ ] Time-out.  
> Incorrect. No removal from environment occurred.  

# 
A teacher removes a student from the classroom for disruptive behavior.  

This question tests exclusion time-out knowledge.  

1. [ ] Non-exclusion time-out.  
> Incorrect. The student is removed.  

2. [x] Exclusion time-out.  
> Correct! Student is removed from the environment (pp. 343–344).  

3. [ ] Response cost.  
> Incorrect. No specific reinforcer was lost.  

4. [ ] Overcorrection.  
> Incorrect. No corrective behavior was required.  

# 
A student has their tokens removed for interrupting.  

This question examines response cost.  

1. [ ] Positive punishment.  
> Incorrect. No stimulus was added.  

2. [x] Response cost.  
> Correct! A specific reinforcer (tokens) is removed (p. 344).  

3. [ ] Time-out.  
> Incorrect. Time-out removes access to all reinforcement, not specific tokens.  

4. [ ] Restitutional overcorrection.  
> Incorrect. No corrective effort was required.  

# 
Punishment is delivered inconsistently across sessions.  

This question focuses on factors reducing punishment effectiveness.  

1. [ ] Increases suppression.  
> Incorrect. Inconsistent punishment weakens suppression.  

2. [x] Reduces punishment effectiveness.  
> Correct! Consistency is critical for suppression (p. 340).  

3. [ ] Has no effect.  
> Incorrect. Effectiveness clearly decreases.  

4. [ ] Enhances generalization.  
> Incorrect. Generalization is unrelated here.  

# 
A child engages in aggression after being punished for shouting.  

This question identifies side effects of punishment.  

1. [ ] Behavioral momentum.  
> Incorrect. This describes persistence under reinforcement.  

2. [ ] Spontaneous recovery.  
> Incorrect. That applies to extinction, not punishment.  

3. [x] Aggression.  
> Correct! Aggression is a common side effect (pp. 347–349).  

4. [ ] Generalization.  
> Incorrect. Generalization refers to spread of behavior, not side effects.  

# 
After punishment is discontinued, the suppressed behavior increases again.  

This question checks knowledge of recovery from punishment effect.  

1. [ ] Permanent suppression.  
> Incorrect. Recovery demonstrates impermanence.  

2. [x] Temporary suppression.  
> Correct! Behavior often returns once punishment is removed (p. 341).  

3. [ ] Stronger extinction effects.  
> Incorrect. Recovery effect is specific to punishment, not extinction.  

4. [ ] Only occurs on continuous schedules.  
> Incorrect. Recovery can occur across schedules.  

# 
A child is praised for sitting quietly while being punished for aggression.  

This question assesses combining punishment with reinforcement.  

1. [ ] Suppresses all topographies.  
> Incorrect. Reinforcement targets specific alternatives.  

2. [ ] Prevents habituation to punishers.  
> Incorrect. Habituation is not the key issue here.  

3. [x] Promotes skill acquisition and long-term change.  
> Correct! Pairing punishment with reinforcement builds replacement skills (pp. 349–350).  

4. [ ] Eliminates extinction bursts.  
> Incorrect. Extinction bursts may still occur.  

# 
A time-out is implemented in a classroom where few reinforcers are available.  

This question tests conditions for time-out effectiveness.  

1. [x] Ineffective because time-in is not reinforcing.  
> Correct! For time-out to work, time-in must be reinforcing (pp. 343–344).  

2. [ ] Effective because time-out always decreases behavior.  
> Incorrect. Its effectiveness depends on reinforcement conditions.  

3. [ ] Works better if duration is very long.  
> Incorrect. Long time-outs are not necessarily effective.  

4. [ ] Only effective when paired with extinction.  
> Incorrect. Extinction may help but is not required.  

# 
A therapist uses varied warning signals before different aversive events.  

This question examines generalization of avoidance responding.  

1. [x] Promotes generalization.  
> Correct! Pairing varied aversives with warnings strengthens generalized avoidance (p. 308).  

2. [ ] Reduces stimulus control.  
> Incorrect. It increases generalization, not reduces control.  

3. [ ] Creates extinction bursts.  
> Incorrect. That relates to extinction procedures.  

4. [ ] Weakens avoidance behavior.  
> Incorrect. It strengthens avoidance responses.
