# Which of the following best defines positive reinforcement?

This question tests understanding of the formal definition of positive reinforcement versus related but inaccurate descriptions.

> According to the source, which option best captures the definition of positive reinforcement?

1. [ ] The presentation of a stimulus following a response that strengthens the person.  
> Incorrect. Reinforcement strengthens **behavior**, not people.  

2. [x] A stimulus change that follows a response and increases the future occurrence of similar responses.  
> Correct! Positive reinforcement is explicitly defined as a response followed immediately by a stimulus change that results in an increased likelihood of that behavior occurring in the future.  

3. [ ] A consequence that provides positive feedback to the learner about their performance.  
> Incorrect. Feedback is information, not reinforcement; it may or may not affect future responding.  

4. [ ] The removal of an aversive stimulus following a response, leading to an increase in that response.  
> Incorrect. This describes negative reinforcement, not positive reinforcement.  

# According to the sources, why is a response-to-reinforcement delay of even one second considered less effective than immediate reinforcement?

This question tests knowledge of how temporal contiguity affects the effectiveness of reinforcement.

> According to the source, what is the primary reason even a one-second delay weakens reinforcement?

1. [ ] A one-second delay is too short for the learner to be aware that reinforcement has occurred.  
> Incorrect. Awareness is not required for reinforcement to occur; this principle is called the automaticity of reinforcement.  

2. [ ] Delayed consequences can only influence behaviour through rule-governed behaviour.  
> Incorrect. While long delays often require rules, even very short delays weaken the direct effect of reinforcement.  

3. [x] Behaviours other than the target behaviour can occur during the delay and be adventitiously reinforced.  
> Correct! Any delay allows competing behaviours to occur, and the behaviour temporally closest to the reinforcer is the one most likely to be strengthened.  

4. [ ] The learner must be able to verbalise the contingency for reinforcement to be effective.  
> Incorrect. Reinforcement works even if the person cannot describe or articulate the contingency.  

# Under which condition is a behaviour most likely rule-governed rather than a direct effect of reinforcement?

This question tests the distinction between rule-governed behaviour and behaviour directly shaped by immediate reinforcement.

> According to the source, which condition best indicates rule-governed behaviour?

1. [ ] The response-consequence delay is less than one second.  
> Incorrect. A very short delay suggests direct effects of reinforcement, not rule-governed behaviour.  

2. [ ] The behaviour changes only after multiple instances of reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. In fact, a large increase in behaviour after just one reinforcement is a stronger marker of rule-governed behaviour.  

3. [x] No immediate consequence for the behaviour is apparent, but a verbal description of the contingency exists.  
> Correct! Rule-governed behaviour occurs when behaviour is influenced by verbal descriptions of contingencies rather than direct, immediate consequences.  

4. [ ] The behaviour is strengthened because the person is aware of the reinforcing connection.  
> Incorrect. Awareness is not required for reinforcement to affect behaviour directly.  

# What component is added to the three-term contingency (SD → R → SR+) to create the four-term contingency for positive reinforcement?

This question tests knowledge of how motivating operations extend the three-term contingency into a four-term contingency.

> According to the source, which component is added to create the four-term contingency?

1. [ ] An abolishing operation (AO).  
> Incorrect. An AO decreases the effectiveness of a reinforcer, but the four-term contingency highlights conditions that increase its effectiveness.  

2. [ ] A stimulus delta (SΔ).  
> Incorrect. The SΔ is already part of the three-term contingency, signaling when reinforcement is unavailable.  

3. [x] An establishing operation (EO).  
> Correct! The four-term contingency adds the motivating operation—specifically the EO—which increases the momentary effectiveness of a reinforcer.  

4. [ ] Automatic reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. Automatic reinforcement is a type of reinforcement, not an additional structural component of the contingency.  

# Which statement represents a common mistake when talking about reinforcement?

This question tests the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect technical use of reinforcement terminology.

> According to the source, which statement misuses reinforcement terminology?

1. [ ] "The teacher reinforced the student's question-asking behaviour."  
> Incorrect. This is correct usage: behaviours, not people, are reinforced.  

2. [x] "Practising the skill of solving math problems serves as the reinforcer for that skill."  
> Correct! Practising is a behaviour that can be reinforced, but it is not a reinforcer itself. This is a misuse of terminology.  

3. [ ] "The praise functioned as a conditioned reinforcer."  
> Incorrect. Praise is indeed a common example of a conditioned reinforcer.  

4. [ ] "The reinforcer was delivered on a continuous schedule."  
> Incorrect. This is a correct description of a reinforcement schedule.  

# The concept of "automaticity of reinforcement" means that:

This question tests understanding of the principle that reinforcement does not require awareness to be effective.

> According to the source, what best defines the concept of automaticity of reinforcement?

1. [ ] The reinforcement is delivered by a machine or technology.  
> Incorrect. That describes a method of delivery, not the principle.  

2. [ ] The behaviour produces its own reinforcement without social mediation.  
> Incorrect. That is the definition of **automatic reinforcement**, which is a different concept.  

3. [x] The person does not need to be aware of the contingency for reinforcement to occur.  
> Correct! Automaticity means reinforcement operates regardless of the person’s awareness or understanding of the contingency.  

4. [ ] The reinforcement is the product of the species' evolutionary history.  
> Incorrect. That refers to unconditioned reinforcers, not automaticity of reinforcement.  

# What is the primary difference between an unconditioned reinforcer and a conditioned reinforcer?

This question tests understanding of the role of learning history in differentiating reinforcer types.

> According to the source, what best distinguishes unconditioned from conditioned reinforcers?

1. [ ] Unconditioned reinforcers are more powerful than conditioned reinforcers.  
> Incorrect. The effectiveness of a reinforcer depends on motivating operations, not whether it is conditioned or unconditioned.  

2. [x] Unconditioned reinforcers do not require a learning history, whereas conditioned reinforcers do.  
> Correct! Unconditioned reinforcers (primary) are effective due to evolutionary history, while conditioned reinforcers (secondary) gain their value through pairing with other reinforcers.  

3. [ ] Unconditioned reinforcers are always tangible items, while conditioned reinforcers are social.  
> Incorrect. That’s an overgeneralisation—warmth is an unconditioned reinforcer that isn’t tangible, and tokens are tangible conditioned reinforcers.  

4. [ ] Unconditioned reinforcers depend on an EO, whereas conditioned reinforcers do not.  
> Incorrect. Both types require relevant motivating operations to be effective.  

# Money and social attention are often cited as examples of generalised conditioned reinforcers because their effectiveness:

This question tests understanding of why generalised conditioned reinforcers maintain value across multiple conditions.

> According to the source, what best explains the effectiveness of generalised conditioned reinforcers?

1. [ ] Is the same across all individuals and cultures.  
> Incorrect. Their value is learned and can vary across people and cultural contexts.  

2. [ ] Is based on a direct pairing with a single powerful unconditioned reinforcer.  
> Incorrect. They are effective because they’ve been paired with many different reinforcers, not just one.  

3. [x] Does not depend on a current establishing operation for any particular form of reinforcement.  
> Correct! Generalised conditioned reinforcers retain effectiveness because they’ve been paired with multiple reinforcers, reducing dependence on any single EO.  

4. [ ] Can strengthen a wide range of different behaviours.  
> Incorrect. Any reinforcer can strengthen many behaviours; what makes a reinforcer “generalised” is its broad effectiveness across EOs.

# Which of the following scenarios best illustrates the Premack principle?

This question tests understanding of how high-probability behaviours can serve as reinforcers for low-probability behaviours.

> According to the source, which scenario demonstrates the Premack principle?

1. [x] A student who loves reading is told, "If you finish your maths worksheet, you can read for 10 minutes."  
> Correct! The Premack principle uses access to a high-frequency behaviour (reading) as reinforcement for a low-frequency behaviour (completing maths work).  

2. [ ] A student is given a sticker for every five maths problems they complete correctly.  
> Incorrect. This is tangible reinforcement on a fixed-ratio schedule, not the Premack principle.  

3. [ ] A student who misbehaves has to stay in for recess, which reduces misbehaviour.  
> Incorrect. This describes punishment, not reinforcement.  

4. [ ] A teacher praises a student for working quietly, and the student's quiet work increases.  
> Incorrect. This is an example of social reinforcement, not the Premack principle.  

# What is the key distinction between a stimulus preference assessment and a reinforcer assessment?

This question tests the difference between identifying preferred stimuli and confirming their reinforcing effects.

> According to the source, what best distinguishes SPAs from reinforcer assessments?

1. [x] SPAs identify highly preferred stimuli, while reinforcer assessments directly test if those stimuli increase behaviour.  
> Correct! SPAs predict which stimuli may act as reinforcers, while reinforcer assessments verify their effect on behaviour by testing them contingently.  

2. [ ] SPAs are trial-based methods, while reinforcer assessments are based on free-operant observation.  
> Incorrect. Both assessments can use trial-based or free-operant formats.  

3. [ ] SPAs can only be used for individuals with verbal skills, while reinforcer assessments are for non-verbal individuals.  
> Incorrect. Both assessments can be adapted for learners regardless of verbal ability.  

4. [ ] SPAs identify unconditioned reinforcers, while reinforcer assessments identify conditioned reinforcers.  
> Incorrect. Either type of assessment can be applied to unconditioned or conditioned reinforcers.  

# In a multiple-stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessment, what happens after the individual selects an item from the array?

This question tests knowledge of the MSWO procedure and how selections shape subsequent trials.

> According to the source, what occurs after an item is selected in MSWO?

1. [ ] The chosen item remains, and all other items are replaced with new ones.  
> Incorrect. That describes the multiple-stimulus *with* replacement (MSWI) procedure.  

2. [x] The chosen item is removed, and the remaining items are presented again.  
> Correct! In MSWO, the selected item is removed from the array, and the assessment continues with the remaining items until all are chosen or responding stops.  

3. [ ] The individual gets to keep the item, and the assessment ends.  
> Incorrect. The assessment typically continues until all items are selected or the learner stops making choices.  

4. [ ] The chosen item is returned to the array, and the positions are randomised for the next trial.  
> Incorrect. In MSWO, the selected item is *not* replaced in the array.  

# A progressive-ratio schedule reinforcer assessment is useful for determining:

This question tests understanding of how progressive-ratio schedules evaluate reinforcer strength under increasing response demands.

> According to the source, what is measured by a progressive-ratio reinforcer assessment?

1. [ ] The initial preference hierarchy among a large number of stimuli.  
> Incorrect. That is the purpose of a stimulus preference assessment.  

2. [ ] Whether a low-preference stimulus can function as a reinforcer.  
> Incorrect. A concurrent or single-schedule reinforcer assessment would address this more directly.  

3. [x] The relative effectiveness of a reinforcer as response requirements increase.  
> Correct! Progressive-ratio schedules raise the effort requirement systematically, showing how well a reinforcer maintains responding as the “cost” increases.  

4. [ ] If a stimulus is an unconditioned or conditioned reinforcer.  
> Incorrect. That distinction depends on learning history, not on an assessment schedule.  

# According to Thompson and Iwata (2005), which control procedure offers the most unconfounded demonstration of the effects of positive reinforcement?

This question tests knowledge of experimental control procedures for evaluating reinforcement effects.

> According to the source, which control procedure is considered the strongest for isolating reinforcement effects?

1. [ ] Extinction (reversal to baseline).  
> Incorrect. Extinction makes it difficult to separate the effects of stimulus removal from the contingency itself and can introduce unwanted side effects.  

2. [ ] Differential Reinforcement of Other Behaviour (DRO).  
> Incorrect. DRO adds a new contingency, which can confound interpretation of behaviour change.  

3. [x] Noncontingent Reinforcement (NCR).  
> Correct! NCR delivers the stimulus independently of behaviour, removing the contingency but controlling for stimulus presentation, making it the cleanest control for reinforcement effects.  

4. [ ] Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behaviour (DRA).  
> Incorrect. DRA also introduces a new contingency, which can obscure whether behaviour change was due to reinforcement or the alternative response being strengthened.  

# When setting an initial criterion for reinforcement for a behaviour you want to increase, the criterion should be:

This question tests knowledge of how to set effective and achievable initial reinforcement criteria.

> According to the source, what is the best guideline for setting an initial criterion?

1. [ ] Higher than the person's best performance during baseline to encourage effort.  
> Incorrect. Setting the bar too high risks no reinforcement being delivered, which undermines behaviour change.  

2. [ ] Lower than the person's average baseline performance.  
> Incorrect. This would not require improvement in the target behaviour.  

3. [ ] Equal to the person's average baseline performance.  
> Incorrect. Matching baseline performance does not encourage improvement.  

4. [x] Higher than the average baseline performance but lower than or equal to the best baseline performance.  
> Correct! This ensures the criterion is attainable while still promoting measurable progress beyond average performance.  

# Negative reinforcement occurs when the future occurrence of a response increases because that response results in the:

This question tests the precise definition of negative reinforcement and how it differs from other operant processes.

> According to the source, what outcome defines negative reinforcement?

1. [ ] Presentation of an aversive stimulus.  
> Incorrect. That describes positive punishment.  

2. [ ] Presentation of a preferred stimulus.  
> Incorrect. That is positive reinforcement.  

3. [x] Termination, reduction, or postponement of a stimulus.  
> Correct! Negative reinforcement occurs when behaviour increases because it removes, reduces, or delays an aversive stimulus.  

4. [ ] Withholding of a preferred stimulus.  
> Incorrect. That is a feature of negative punishment.  

# A primary source of confusion between negative reinforcement and punishment is that:

This question tests understanding of why these two procedures are often mistakenly equated.

> According to the source, what factor most contributes to confusion between negative reinforcement and punishment?

1. [ ] Both procedures result in a decrease in future behaviour.  
> Incorrect. Negative reinforcement increases behaviour, while punishment decreases it.  

2. [ ] Both procedures involve the presentation of a stimulus following behaviour.  
> Incorrect. Negative reinforcement involves stimulus termination, not presentation.  

3. [x] The stimuli involved in both can be described as "aversive."  
> Correct! The same aversive stimuli can function as negative reinforcers when removed and as punishers when presented, creating confusion.  

4. [ ] The terms "positive" and "negative" refer to whether the procedure is good or bad.  
> Incorrect. Positive and negative describe whether a stimulus is presented or removed, not value judgments.  

# A student starts their homework as soon as their parent gives a warning ("If you don't start in 10 minutes, you'll have to do it in your room") to prevent having to work in their room. This is an example of:

This question tests the ability to differentiate among avoidance and escape contingencies.

> According to the source, which contingency best describes this scenario?

1. [ ] Escape contingency.  
> Incorrect. Escape involves ending an *ongoing* aversive stimulus, not preventing one.  

2. [ ] Free-operant avoidance.  
> Incorrect. Free-operant avoidance does not require a warning signal; behaviour can occur at any time to postpone the aversive event.  

3. [x] Discriminated avoidance.  
> Correct! The parent’s warning serves as a discriminative stimulus signaling that starting homework will prevent the aversive consequence (working in the room).  

4. [ ] Automatic negative reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. The contingency here is socially mediated by the parent, not automatic.  

# Research on error-correction strategies (e.g., having a student repeat a misread word) suggests that their effectiveness may be due, at least in part, to:

This question tests understanding of how contingencies within error-correction procedures influence behaviour change.

> According to the source, what contingency best explains the effectiveness of error-correction strategies?

1. [ ] The positive reinforcement from the teacher's approval.  
> Incorrect. The studies were designed to isolate the effects of the correction procedure, not teacher approval.  

2. [ ] The student's improved understanding of the material through practice.  
> Incorrect. Performance improvements occurred even when the remedial tasks were irrelevant to the skill being taught.  

3. [x] A negative reinforcement contingency, where correct performance avoids the remedial procedure.  
> Correct! The data suggest that correct responding is strengthened by avoiding the extra (and sometimes irrelevant) work, which is negative reinforcement.  

4. [ ] A punishment contingency, where the extra work decreases future errors.  
> Incorrect. The primary effect observed was the avoidance of the extra task, not a punishment process.  

# How is extinction applied to a behaviour maintained by negative reinforcement?

This question tests knowledge of how extinction procedures differ depending on the maintaining contingency.

> According to the source, how is extinction implemented for behaviours maintained by negative reinforcement?

1. [ ] By providing positive reinforcement for an alternative behaviour.  
> Incorrect. That describes Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behaviour (DRA), not extinction.  

2. [ ] By presenting a punishing consequence for the problem behaviour.  
> Incorrect. That procedure is punishment, not extinction.  

3. [x] By no longer allowing the response to terminate or avoid the aversive stimulus.  
> Correct! Extinction for negatively reinforced behaviour requires preventing escape or avoidance, ensuring the aversive condition continues despite the behaviour.  

4. [ ] By ignoring the problem behaviour completely.  
> Incorrect. Simply ignoring escape-maintained behaviour can reinforce it; extinction requires persistence of the demand or aversive event.  

# A primary ethical concern related to the use of negative reinforcement is that:

This question tests understanding of the ethical implications of employing negative reinforcement in behaviour-change programs.

> According to the source, what is the main ethical concern with negative reinforcement?

1. [ ] It is less effective than positive reinforcement.  
> Incorrect. Negative reinforcement can be highly effective and sometimes more effective than positive reinforcement in certain contexts.  

2. [x] The establishing operations are, by definition, aversive events.  
> Correct! Negative reinforcement relies on aversive antecedent conditions, and using highly noxious events to occasion behaviour raises ethical concerns.  

3. [ ] It can only be used to decrease behaviour.  
> Incorrect. Like positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement functions to increase behaviour.  

4. [ ] It requires the use of unconditioned reinforcers.  
> Incorrect. Negative reinforcement can involve either unconditioned (e.g., shock, intense light) or conditioned (e.g., nagging) stimuli.
